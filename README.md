Date datatype
Time datatype
time zones

Postgres stores dates/times as UTC

Timezones to consider:
"Darwin" => "Australia/Darwin", 
"Adelaide" => "Australia/Adelaide", 
"Canberra" => "Australia/Melbourne", 
"Melbourne" => "Australia/Melbourne", 
"Sydney" => "Australia/Sydney", 
"Brisbane" => "Australia/Brisbane", 
"Hobart" => "Australia/Hobart", 

Assumptions:
Jobs start and finish on the same day, or timesheets are only recorded for work that day
